CODE DESCRIPTION:
This script captures an image from the webcam after warming up the camera,
and saves it in the ImageTest folder. If the folder doesnâ€™t exist,
the script creates it.

'''
import cv2
import os

# Set the camera port (0 is usually the default webcam, use 1 for an external webcam)
camera_port = 0

# Number of frames to capture for warming up the camera
ramp_frames = 10

# Initialize video capture using the specified camera port
# (0 refers to the default camera)
camera = cv2.VideoCapture(camera_port)

# Define a function to capture a frame (image) from the webcam
def get_image():
    retval, img = camera.read()  # captures frame from the webcam
    return img

# Warm-up phase: Capture and discard several frames to allow the camera to adjust (improves image quality)
for i in range(ramp_frames):
    temp = get_image()  # Capture a temporary image (not saved)
    print("CAPTURING PIC")  # Print a message indicating the frame is captured

# After the warm-up, capture the final image to be saved
camera_capture = get_image()

# Specify the directory where the image will be saved
output_dir = "ImageTest"  # Folder named 'ImageTest' will be used for saving the image

# Check if the folder exists, and if it doesn't, create it
if not os.path.exists(output_dir):
    os.makedirs(output_dir)  # Create the folder if it doesn't exist

# Define the path and filename where the image will be saved
file = os.path.join(output_dir, "test_image_f1.png")

# Save the captured image as 'test_image_f1.png' in the 'ImageTest' folder
cv2.imwrite(file, camera_capture)

# Release the camera resource so that it can be used by other applications
del camera

# Print a message to indicate the image has been saved successfully
print(f"Image saved to {file}")
